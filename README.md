# Stopwatch
---
A simple stopwatch app that allows the user to start, stop, and reset the timer and record laps.

### Technologies Used:

* ES6 with Babel
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Sass

ES6/React/Redux/Webpack were all used because I am currently working on another project using that same system, so I am most comfortable in it. I've been using Sass for all projects for years now.

The overall structure of the app could probably be tightened up a bit (including the issue of calling it a "clock" and "timer"), but I like it well enough. I tried to keep it simple style-wise. I also decided to show the splits between laps because I think that's important information for a person registering laps.
